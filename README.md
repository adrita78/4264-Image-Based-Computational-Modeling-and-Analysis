# Image-Based Computational Modeling and Analysis

This repository contains code and notebooks for the project on Image-Based Computational Modeling and Analysis.

## Project Files

- **Registration_CNN.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the main CNN-based registration process.
- **epoch74-BEST-0.0209.pth**: Pre-trained model checkpoint at epoch 74 with the best performance (MSE loss: 0.0209).
- **preprocessing.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook covering data preprocessing steps.
- **test.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for testing and evaluation.
- **train.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for model training.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used in the project.

## Instructions

### 1. Registration_CNN.ipynb
   - Use this notebook to understand the main CNN-based registration process.

### 2. epoch74-BEST-0.0209.pth
   - Pre-trained model checkpoint. You can load and use this checkpoint for further tasks without retraining.

### 3. preprocessing.ipynb
   - Explore data preprocessing steps and transformations applied to the input images.

### 4. test.ipynb
   - Notebook for testing the trained model and evaluating its performance.

### 5. train.ipynb
   - Notebook for training the model. Modify hyperparameters and settings as needed.

### 6. utils.py
   - Utility functions used throughout the project.
